# HostGuard

A BepInEx/Reactor mod for Among Us that gives hosts full control over their lobbies. Filters bad names, blocks cheaters, stops bot floods, and more — all configurable in-game or via config file.

## Features

### Name Filter
- Kick/ban players with offensive names (exact or substring match)
- Kick players with randomly generated default names (e.g. Funnybone)
- Strict or loose casing modes for default name detection

### Chat Filter
- Kick/ban players who type banned words (exact or substring match)
- Detect and ban bots that post known malicious URLs

### Bot Protection
- Auto-kick/ban known bot names (TNT, auser, Haunt Bot, etc.)
- Cosmetic crash prevention — blocks players with malformed outfit data

### Flood Protection
- Detect and block join flooding (rapid mass joins)
- Detect rapid join-leave attacks
- Auto-lock lobby during flood attacks with configurable cooldown
- Meeting spam detection and kick

### Anti-Cheat
- RPC validation — blocks kill/vent/shapeshift exploits in lobby and invalid role actions in-game
- Chat rate limiting (silently blocks spam without kicking)

### Minimum Level
- Require a minimum player level to join

### Auto-Start
- Auto-start when lobby reaches a target player count
- Auto-start when lobby countdown timer is about to expire

### Lobby Management
- Auto-return to lobby after game ends (skips post-game screens)
- Lock/unlock lobby via commands
- Rules message shown to host on lobby start
- Toast notifications when HostGuard takes action

### Whitelist & Blacklist
- Whitelist players by friend code (immune to all checks)
- Persistent blacklist (survives game restarts)
- Auto-blacklist option for every violation type
- Google Sheets ban list integration for shared community bans

### Presets
- Save/load HostGuard config presets
- Save/load game option presets (speed, kill cooldown, tasks, etc.)

### In-Game Settings Panel
- Full settings UI accessible from a lobby button
- Toggle every feature, adjust thresholds, manage lists — no config file editing needed

## Requirements

- Among Us (Steam) v2024.11.26+

## Installation

1. Uninstall Among Us, delete the Among Us folder, and reinstall through Steam
2. Download and extract BepInEx into your Among Us folder (where `Among Us.exe` is)
3. Launch Among Us once so BepInEx sets itself up, then close it
4. Download `Reactor.dll` from the Reactor releases page and drop it into `BepInEx/plugins/`
5. Download `HostGuard.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/RaresHonour/HostGuard/releases/latest) and drop it into `BepInEx/plugins/`
